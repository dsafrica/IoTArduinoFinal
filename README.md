# IoTArduinoFinal
Repository For Arduino Code

This Repository will act as the working point for the Arduino for the project

Right now it will only contain the Arduino code from lab 3 as the TimeoutTimer.h 
file needed to run the code.

All of the Arduino Libraries necessary should be installed already from completing
Lab 1 through Lab 3.

Easiest way to work and access it is through GitHub Desktop
