# IoTArduinoFinal
Repository For Arduino Code

This Repository will act as the working point for the Arduino for the project

Right now it will only contain the Arduino code from lab 3 as the TimeoutTimer.h 
file needed to run the code.

All of the Arduino Libraries necessary should be installed already from completing
Lab 1 through Lab 3.

Easiest way to work and access it is through GitHub Desktop
Should just be able to clone the respository from the URL above or
https://github.com/dsafrica/IoTArduinoFinal.git

Save it to wherever you want locally, there will be a README file and an ArduinoFinal folder with 
the to files necessary to run the Ardunio code.

Make sure to always pull from Github Desktop before you make any changes and to always push it 
to the origin when you make an changes.
